; TODO
; * no ClojureScript library
; * large code footprint, even for the simplest of views
; ** probably not anything we can do about that in general (e.g. use `map`, get all the code for collections, seqs, etc)
; * namespaces and function names and gensyms might be tricky:
; ** how long-lived are the view servers?  How about in non-Apache CouchDB (cloudant)?
; ** def'ing named vars might cause collisions, unintentional use of different versions of required cljs code, etc
; ** maybe not a problem; see what large view implementations do in terms of namespacing

   (i.e. circa couchdb ~1.0.2), but couchdb 1.2 will begin to require that view/filter/validation
   code be defined in a single _expression_.  This is necessary to ensure that we're producing a
   single expression, given Google Closure's penchant for lifting
   closures to the top level of advanced-optimized code (even if the code provided to it is entirely
   contained within a closure itself, making lifting somewhat pointless AFAICT)."

(def view
  "Compiles a body of ClojureScript into a single Javascript expression, suitable for use in a
   CouchDB view.  First argument may be a map of options; remaining arguments must be either
   (a) a single anonymous function, or (b) a series of top-level ClojureScript forms, starting
   with an `ns` declaration.  If (b), the map of options must include a `:main` entry to identify
   the \"entry point\" for the CouchDB view/filter/validator/etc.

   Contrived examples:

   (view nil '(fn [doc]
                (js/emit (aget doc \"_id\") nil)))

   (view {:main 'some-view/main}
     '(ns some-view)
     '(defn date-components [date]
        (-> (re-seq #\"(\\d{4})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{2})\" date)
          first
          rest))
     '(defn main [doc]
        (js/emit (apply array (-> doc (aget \"date\") date-components)) nil)))

   If using clutch, you should never have to touch this function.  It is registered with clutch
   as a view-transformer; just use the view-server-fns macro, indicating a view server language of
   :cljs. 

   You can also include ClojureScript/Google Closure compiler options in the options map, e.g.
   :optimizations, :pretty-print, etc.  These options default to :advanced compilation, no
   pretty-printing."
