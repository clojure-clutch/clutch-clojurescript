; TODO
; * no ClojureScript library
; * large code footprint, even for the simplest of views
; ** probably not anything we can do about that in general (e.g. use `map`, get all the code for collections, seqs, etc)
; * namespaces and function names and gensyms might be tricky:
; ** how long-lived are the view servers?  How about in non-Apache CouchDB (cloudant)?
; ** def'ing named vars might cause collisions, unintentional use of different versions of required cljs code, etc
; ** maybe not a problem; see what large view implementations do in terms of namespacing

   closures to the top level of advanced-optimized code (even if the code provided to it is entirely
   contained within a closure itself, making lifting somewhat pointless AFAICT)."
